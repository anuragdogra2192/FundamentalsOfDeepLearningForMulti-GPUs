    "So far you've learned about the difference between gradient descent (i.e. a batch size equal to the full dataset) and mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (the batch size is smaller than the full dataset, usually much smaller). You've seen that smaller batch sizes add noise to the optimization process, which can help with avoiding getting trapped in local minima or slowed down at a saddle point. A smaller batch size will also mean running back-propagation and updating the gradients more times per epoch (taking more steps).\n",

The original MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 pictures of handwritten digits, 0-9. One of the downsides of this dataset is its simplicity. Good performance of a model on the dataset does not indicate that the model will perform well on a more complicated set of images.\n",

It follows the same format as the original MNIST set, with 10 categories and 60,000 images, each 28x28 pixels (plus 10,000 testing images). We'll be training on this dataset for this exercise, as well as for the next labs where we'll introduce training with multiple GPUs. \n",

Since GPU processing performance depends on hiding latency by having lots of work to do, performance for small batches will be relatively poor, and performance for large enough batches will eventually use all of the GPU cores effectively, and the throughput (number of images processed per second) will approach a ceiling."
