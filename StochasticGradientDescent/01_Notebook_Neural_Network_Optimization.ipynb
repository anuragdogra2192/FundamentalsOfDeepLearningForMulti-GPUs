There exists a wide range of optimization algorithms to choose from (for a more detailed discussion refer to chapter 8 of the [Deep Learning Book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/optimization.html)). In this exercise we will use one of the most basic optimization algorithms, **gradient descent**. The mechanism by which gradient descent operates is illustrated in the figure below (bear in mind that for non-convex functions, which applies to the majority of neural networks, the algorithm may end up seeking a good local minimum instead of a global one):\n",

Then the gradient of the loss function is calculated (in this simple case, it is the slope of the line tangent to the curve). Once the gradient is calculated it can be used to slowly move towards the optimal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice gradient descent (or even the stochastic gradient descent method discussed below) is rarely used directly. Instead more effective variants exist that allow the algorithm to find the solution faster and provide better stability during computation. Note also that it is rarely the case that the gradient calculation and optimization logic must be written from scratch. Instead, all the key deep learning frameworks provide auto differentiation as well as a wide range of optimization algorithms. In our case we will choose a built-in implementation of gradient descent provided by the framework."

The optimizer called in the loop will then make small changes to the model parameters, bringing it closer and closer to our desired solution.

There is no universal definition of convergence, so you'll have to pick one that is appropriate for this problem. One possible choice is to stop training when the loss function changes by less than 0.1% between epochs. (Consider testing over a suitable average of previous epochs.) You could also choose to consider how fast the model parameters are changing. If you get stuck, you can always remove the convergence check and control the training process by modifying `max_number_of_epochs`."

This has profound implications for the behavior of our algorithm. Since every batch is different, even for the same set of weights, the calculated loss will be different for an individual batch than for the entire dataset. Since the loss function is different for the batch, the gradient of the loss function will be different as well, which introduces a level of noise.\n",

Since those curves are different the estimation of the gradient will be different at every step.

    "So, we've now compared two extremes: stochastic gradient descent where the batch size is the full dataset (that is, traditional gradient descent), and SGD where the batch size is 1. Let's try out some batch sizes in the middle. To do this, modify the code we used above to pass a subset of the data to be trained on in each step. All you need to do is loop through the dataset in order, passing each consecutive chunk of batch size M to the optimizer. Your implementation ideally should work for any number M where 1 <= M <= N, where N is the number of items in the dataset. The dataset will usually not be evenly divisible by the size of the batch, so make sure you handle the last batch in the dataset by just using all the remaining items (so it will be a smaller batch)."
